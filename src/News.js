      'Apple has announced a "self-service repair" programme so "customers who are comfortable" can fix their own devices At launch, in early 2022 in the US, it will cover replacing the batteries, screens and cameras of recent iPhones. But Apple\'s new repair store will sell more than 200 parts and tools. It comes after months of increasing pressure on Apple from the grassroots right-to-repair movement, which wants individuals and independent repair shops to be able to fix electronics."Self Service Repair is intended for individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices," Apple said. But "for the vast majority of customers" visiting a certified professional repair shop would be a better option."Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed," Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said."By designing products for durability, longevity, and increased repairability, customers enjoy a long-lasting product that holds its value for years," the company said.',

      "Many of the people on the FBI's cyber most wanted list are Russian. While some allegedly work for the government earning a normal salary, others are accused of making a fortune from ransomware attacks and online theft. If they left Russia they'd be arrested - but at home they appear to be given free rein.\"We're wasting our time,\" I thought, as I watched a cat licking the carcass of a discarded takeaway chicken. Surely there would no longer be any trace of an alleged multi-millionaire cyber-criminal on this dilapidated estate in a run-down town 700km (400 miles) east of Moscow. But I pressed on with an interpreter and cameraman, shooing the mangy cat away from the entrance to the block of flats. When we knocked at one of the doors, a young man answered and a curious elderly woman peered around the corner at us from the kitchen. \"Igor Turashev? No, I don't recognise the name,\" he said.",

But only one in 50 has taken part in a "risky and dangerous" - and fewer than one in 300 a "really dangerous" - one. The survey looked at teenagers\' broad online experience, without focusing on any one platform.\'Skull-breaker\' challenge There has been widespread concern about the proliferation, across various platforms, of potentially harmful online challenges. Last year, the "skull-breaker" challenge, shared on TikTok, was linked to injuries. And this year, doctors warned of the risk to life and limb of the "milk-crate challenge", which invited the foolhardy to climb pyramids of milk crates. But online challenges can also be positive and promote worthwhile causes, experts note, such as the "ice-bucket challenge", which helped raise awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).',

Its annual review said protecting the health sector became an urgent priority over the period. The NCSC - part of GCHQ - said one in five incidents were aimed at organisations with links to health. In one case, it helped the University of Oxford, where the AstraZeneca vaccine was developed, to protect itself against an incident which had the potential to cause significant disruption to the UK's pandemic response.According to the NCSC, the growth in reported incidents - from 723 the previous year - was due to it working to proactively identify cyber threats.",

      'Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK from 19 January, the online retail giant has said It said the move was due to high credit card transaction fees but said Visa debit cards would still be accepted. Visa said it was "very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future". Amazon said: "The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers." The online retailer said costs should be going down over time due to advances in technology, "but instead they continue to stay high or even rise". An Amazon spokesperson said the dispute was to do with "pretty egregious" price rises from Visa over a number of years with no additional value to its service. Amazon is offering £20 for Prime customers to switch from using Visa to an alternative payment method, and £10 for other customers.Visa said in a statement it was "very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins."It said it had "a long-standing relationship with Amazon" and that it was trying to resolve the situation so customers would be able to use Visa credit cards with Amazon UK. Amazon declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. Visa also declined to comment though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase.',

By contrast, having to deal with a surly person serving up your pint or margarita it risks significantly reducing your happiness levels. For people with a regular drinking establishment of choice, the person behind the bar can even become a friend and confidant. Or, as renowned Canadian economist, Harry Gordon Johnson once said: "The greatest accomplishment of a bartender lies in his ability to exactly suit his customer."Soon, however, those bar staff might not even be human. Enter Cecilia, a robotic bartender that mixes and serves cocktails, and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to talk to customers in much the same way that Alexa, on an Amazon Echo speaker, or Siri, on an iPhone can respond to you. The unit looks a bit like a tall fruit machine, only with an animated female barmaid - Cecilia - appearing on a large, upright video screen. You either tell her what cocktail you want, or order it on the below touch-screen, and pay for the drink by tapping your bank card or phone. Your cocktail is then mixed and made inside the machine, and dispensed into a glass at the vending slot.',

So to satiate your sugar cravings and at the same time not worry about the scale, try finding a healthy sweet alternative.Mishti Doi, popular from West Bengal, is one of the best go-tos in this department. Set in clay pots, the sweet curd absorbs the fragrance and flavour of the earthen vessel. It is fermented sweet dahi, which is an excellent probiotic, among other things.

People who are trying to shed some weight, usually struggle in finalising foods and beverages they should consume and avoid while dieting. One of the most common beverages is milk. Right from a very young age, we have been taught that milk is healthy and there is no doubt about it. However, this healthy drink contains fat, a macronutrient associated with weight gain. Therefore, the question is should you really avoid it during your weight loss plan. Milk consists of saturated fat and high calories, the two important factors that cannot be ignored when it comes to weight loss. 250 ml of whole milk (1 cup) has nearly 5 grams of fat and 152 calories.

      "With the trailer drop of ‘House of Gucci’, Indian audiences have gone ‘gaga’ over the stellar star cast, the stylish costumes that are fashion goals, and the much-talked accent of the characters. The movie stars Lady Gaga stepping into the shoes of Patrizia Reggiani. Her look, screen presence, and performance as the iconic character in the trailer have been garnering a lot of appreciation. It is believed that the sensational singer and Academy Award-winning actor didn't want anyone to tell her about Patrizia Reggiani as she wanted to discover the person on her own. Talking about her preparation, Gaga said, “I spent a lot of time reading about [Patrizia Reggiani], and watching interviews that she gave. I have also watched interviews about her. But I tried not to read anything, or watch anything that had too much of an opinion, because I really wanted to create my own.”",

The actor is best known for playing Draco Malfoy in the wizarding saga but director Chris Columbus, who helmed the first two movies, has revealed Warner Bros. officials were keen to cast him in the lead role. The filmmaker \"knew\" the young actor would be better as the villainous schoolboy, explaining: \"Tom was a great actor as well, so we thought, let's just dye Tom's hair, give him a scar, give him the glasses and let's see. He did a great Harry Potter reading. The problem is you can really kind of tell when an 11 or 12-year-old kid's hair is dyed.\"",

He played the iconic superhero in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) but believes that lack of follow-up to the 2013 movie 'Man of Steel' has left him with more stories to tell as the character. Cavill told The Hollywood Reporter, \"There is a lot of storytelling for me to do as Superman, and I would absolutely love the opportunity.\"The killing of Zod gave a reason for the character never to kill again. Superman falling to the ground and screaming afterward - I don't think that was originally in the script, but I wanted to show the pain he had. He just killed the last remaining member of his species. That's the choice he made in that moment, and he'll never do that again.\"",
